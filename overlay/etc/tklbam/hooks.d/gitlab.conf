# TurnKey TKLBAM GitLab hook backup/restore config file

# As of v15.2 TurnKey uses the GitLab Omnibus installer and leverages GitLab's
# built-in backup system to collect the required files.
#
# This config file is provided to allow great user config of the tklbam backup.

# For full details of GitLab backup/restore see:
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/raketasks/backup_restore.html
#
# GitLab currently provides 2 different backup strategy options. They are:
#
#    stream - streams the data directly from GitLab to the local backup dir
#           - faster and uses less disk space
#           - less reliable; e.g. will fail if file changes during backup
#
#    copy   - copies the data first, before creating the backup
#           - slower and uses more disk space
#           - much more reliable as it is backing up a copy of the files

# https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/raketasks/backup_restore.html#backup-strategy-option
backup_strategy=copy

# https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/raketasks/backup_restore.html#excluding-specific-directories-from-the-backup
backup_components_skip=""

# Forces the restore process to accept defaults and work non-interatively
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/raketasks/backup_restore.html#restore-prerequisites
restore_force="yes"
